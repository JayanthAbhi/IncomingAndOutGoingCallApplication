* It has a receiver registered to receive events of Incoming and Outgoing call as well.
* It has feature to get incoming phone number as well as outgoing phone number.
* It has feature of knowing the phone state(Idle, Ringing, etc).


Note: This has been tested in phones above Android Oreo Versions and below Android Oreo versions as well.
